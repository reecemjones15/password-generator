# Password Generator

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.3.

This is a simple password-generator application. One of my projects from learning about Angular.  Most of this is from the Stephen Grinder's [The Modern Angular Bootcamp course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-modern-angular-bootcamp).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
